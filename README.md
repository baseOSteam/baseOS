# baseOS
Just WIP OS for computercraft. Dev repository. 

# Installation (v0.5):
1. Go to "stable" branch if you want to download stable version.
2. Download OS to your computercraft PC.
3. Create folders: /home/; /temp/; /userApis/; /userConfig/; /userUtils/; /sysConfig/; I'll use them later.

# Known bugs
* After closing multishell bar you must refresh  main window 2 times via clicking at free space.
